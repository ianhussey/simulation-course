nested data structures needed to be discussed a lot in class, some didn't really get them. Expand on this in the lesson, to show that you can build them yourself, and to show that the simulation structure allows you to scrutinise them.

the metafor of workers with boxes was helpful - each step in the process is a worker taking its object in and out of a box, and passing that box to the next worker, rather than passing the individuals items in the box.



discussion of expand_grid was also helpful to show what its really doing and why its useful.



general discussion was needed for people to get it.
