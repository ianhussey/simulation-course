# Improving your statistical inferences through simulation studies in R 

This repo contains materials for the course "Improving the credibility of future research II: Improving your statistical inferences through simulation studies in R" first taught at the Unviersity of Bern in Spring 2024. 

This course uses Monte-Carlo simulation studies to teach participants to improve their statistical inferences. It is aimed at masters students in psychology.

All simulations are implemented in R using a specific workflow written in [{tidyverse}](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [{purrr}](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) that is designed to maximise ease of writing, interpreting, and reusing code - sometimes at the expense of the speed at which the code runs at. 
Researchers who are already familiar with writing simulations whose simulations may be more computationally intensive should consider implementing them in other dedicated packages such as [{SimDesign}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SimDesign/vignettes/SimDesign-intro.html) or [{simhelpers}](https://meghapsimatrix.github.io/simhelpers/).   

*Note that this course is still in development.*
